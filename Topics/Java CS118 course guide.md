# Welcome 

- So basically remember to put .java in filenames
- Also name your classes the same as the filename

### Starting files

```java
public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      //p    
    }
}
```

### Variables

Do not use ($) or start variable name with an (_) 

#### Variable scope

Where a variable is declared, it only exists within the curly braces
Variables declared outside of methods are instance/ class variables - they maintain values between functions

#### types of variable:
- byte - -2^7 to 2^7-1
- short - 2^15
- int - 2^31
- long - 2^63
- float - 32-bit floating point, roughly 6 digits of precision
- double - 64-bit floating point, roughly 15 digits of precision
- char - 16-bit type representing any character in UTF-16 set
- boolean - T/F

#### Bonus Memes 
 
Declared values are *int* by default so do (Number)L for large numbers

### Objects

Names start with capital letters 

#### String operator 

s.charAt(n); // where n is the position of the chosen character

### Arrays

Store collections of similar objects

#### Declaration

Declaring the array requires 

> type arrayName[] = new type[arrayLength]

Declaring values in the array 

> arrayName[place in array] = x;
